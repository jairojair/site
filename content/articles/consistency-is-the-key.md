### Consistency is The Key

> This week I didn't have any interesting topics to talk about, and I thought, why not talk about consistency? and maybe I can try to motivate myself.

We've all heard it before, consistency is key. But what does that really mean? <br>

It's about showing up, day after day, <br>
even if it's just for a bit.<br>

Think about this. What's better, working on something for 3 hours once a week, or 30 minutes every day? sure, it's the same time, but the impact is not.

#### When you do something consistently

```
- It becomes a habit.
- You start see a little changes.
- You feel motivated to continue.
```
<br>
But here's the catch, life gets in the way. 
We get tired, busy, or just would like a little lazy day, and that's okay. <br>
<br>
<h4>Please don't forget</h4>

Consistency beats intensity.
It's okay to miss a day, just don't miss two.
</br>

So, what's that thing you've been wanting to do?
```
- Start today.
- Do a little bit.
- Then do it again tomorrow.
```
<br>

Keep showing up, see u soon!
