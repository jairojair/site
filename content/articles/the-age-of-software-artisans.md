### The Age of Software Artisans

> *Writing software is dead, long live writing software!*

The world always changes. It’s the only true, everything else is guessing.

People who've worked in tech for a long time know that things come and go. We've been through this before, and we'll go through it many times again.

*Maybe they do now,*  
*in this decadent era of*  
*Lite beer, hand calculators, and "user-friendly" software*  
*but back in the Good Old Days,*  
*when the term "software" sounded funny*  
*and Real Computers were made out of drums and vacuum tubes,*  
*Real Programmers wrote in machine code.*  
*Not FORTRAN.  Not RATFOR.  Not, even, assembly language.*  
*Machine Code.*  
*Raw, unadorned, inscrutable hexadecimal numbers.*  
*Directly.*

#### The age of software artisans is coming.

For years, I've seen people call themselves software artisans. Now that title makes sense.

In the coming years, we'll see more and more people making software like someone building a table in their backyard or garage, they'll enjoy the process and add their own personal touch.

If you love coding the way we do it now, keep at it! enjoy every moment, improve yourself, learn new things, keep coding!

Me? I'll keep writing code my way for fun. But for work, I'll change with the times. That's my choice.

See u soon!
