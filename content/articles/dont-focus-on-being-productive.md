### Don't focus on being productive

Currently, I'm surrounded by videos, posts, and content about productivity, and most times I come to the conclusion that people are productive. 

The problem is that they produce and focus on the "wrong" things, or rather on things different from expectations - what's missing is alignment.

Of course, there are people who, for various reasons, can't get started, but more commonly there are people who work a lot and constantly feel they have low productivity. In these cases, when I ask what their expectations, goals, and final objective were, the answer is just a blur, with no clear definitions.

> Align expectations first, then begin.

It's okay to change "how" to do things during execution, but if the end goal is well-defined, you'll rarely have problems.

If you change course, communicate it. For example, if I'm in traffic and won't arrive on time, I send a message to align expectations.

I might try to find shortcuts and arrive on time, but in these cases, it's better to align with the worst-case scenario and not create false hopes.

```
Be honest
if something goes wrong, communicate it. 
If it goes right, communicate that too.
```

Productivity isn't about doing more things,
it's about doing the right things that match expectations.

See u soon!
