### Solopreneur by Iron Man Mode

This week I was listening to a podcast called [The Bootstrapped Founder][1] by Arvid Kahl, creator of [PodScan][11] and author of the bestseller [Zero to Sold][8].

In the episode titled ["The AI-Powered Solopreneur"][2], he talks about his experience using AI in his daily life as a software entrepreneur, working on various issues.

I have a vision of the future where it will become more common for big companies with few people, or in some cases just one person, to make millions of dollars.

Of course, these people already exist today. [Marc Lou][3], [Pieter Levels][4], and [Arvid][5] himself show that this is possible.

Websites like [Indie Hackers][6] and [Starter Story][7] collect stories of people who changed their lives with their micro-SaaS, products, and newsletters.

All of this will be supercharged as we move towards a new phase of solopreneurship, where anyone, even the most introverted person, now has a 24/7 assistant at their disposal for software, marketing, support - you name it!

> This reminds me of the early Iron Man movies, where Tony Stark talked with [Jarvis][12] and created new suits. We're getting closer to making this a reality!

Combining this with [Paul Graham][9] blog post about [Founder Mode][10], we're about to experience something unique in the world of one-person businesses.

The future of solopreneurship looks bright, with AI assistants acting as our personal Jarvis, helping us create, innovate, and scale our businesses in ways we've only seen in science fiction until now.

See u soon!
